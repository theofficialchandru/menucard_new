Project Outcomes:

I developed a hotel menu card project with three backends: Super

Admin, Hotel Admin, and Django Admin. The Super Admin

manages hotel registrations and permissions, generating unique

QR codes for each hotel. The Hotel Admin handles menu items

and categories, while Django Admin oversees all functionalities.

Customers can scan the QR codes to access specific hotel menus,

providing quick and easy access, enhancing user convenience and

efficient management.
